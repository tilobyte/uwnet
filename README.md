This is a neural network framework developed in C and interfaceable with Python. In addition to the essential feed-forward neural network functions, this framework also supports more advanced features like convolutional layers and batch normalization.

See [src/](./src) for the framework's source code and [tryhw0.py](./tryhw0.py), [tryhw1.py](./tryhw1.py), and [tryhw2.py](./tryhw2.py) for examples of using the framework on datasets including MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Also included in this repository are assignments involving using building CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs using PyTorch ([hw0.ipynb](./hw0.ipynb), [hw1.ipynb](./hw1.ipynb), [hw2.ipynb](./hw2.ipynb))
